## Introduction

This salary dashboard project is my customized take on the original project provided in Luke Barousse's Excel course. It serves as a tool for job seekers to explore salary trends across various roles in data-related fields. This dashboard showcases salaries based on job titles, locations, and job types, enabling users to make informed career decisions.

### Dashboard File

## Dashboard Components

### üìà Visualizations

#### Job Salaries by Role (Bar Chart)

- **Objective**: Highlight salary variations across job roles.
- **Implementation**: A horizontal bar chart sorted by descending salaries for intuitive comparison.
- **Insights**: Senior roles like engineers and managers offer significantly higher pay compared to analyst roles.

#### Median Salaries by Country (Map Chart)

- **Objective**: Understand global salary trends.
- **Implementation**: A map chart with color gradients indicating salary ranges.
- **Insights**: Clear disparities between regions, with countries like the US offering higher median salaries.

### üßÆ Advanced Formulas

#### Median Salary Calculation by Role

**Formula Example:**

```
=MEDIAN(
IF(
    (jobs[job_title_short]=A2)*
    (jobs[job_country]=country)*
    (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(type,jobs[job_schedule_type]))) *
    (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0),
    jobs[salary_year_avg]
)
)
```

- **Purpose**: Calculate median salary based on multiple criteria (role, location, job type).
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Ensures only relevant data is used for accurate results.

#### Unique Job Types List

**Formula Example:**

```
=FILTER(J2#, (NOT(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("and", J2#)) + ISNUMBER(SEARCH(",", J2#)))) * (J2#<>""))
```

- **Purpose**: Generate a clean list of unique job types for filtering.
- **Application**: Used in dropdowns for user input validation.

This ensures consistent input and eliminates errors caused by invalid entries.
